# MowgliBase

This repo holds the Mowgli files that need to be deployed onto your Linux ROS Node.
They may also be deployed onto the Raspi - but i have not tested this.

The various pieces assume that your build matches https://github.com/cloudn1ne/Mowgli/ 

If your build deviates (different IMU, IMU connected to Raspi, etc ..) you will need to adapt the files in this repo.

To get started follow the instructions in [here](help/Setup.md)

## TODO:

* add some pics for the magentometer calibration procedure
