# MowgliRViz

Is a data collector that taps into existing topics like /odom or /ublox/navpt to gather information "at" the bots current location and feed that into a GridMap

## Get started 

As mowgli_rviz does not know the mowing area, you need to supply it the map.bag file from ~/.ros/map.bag on your Bot at least once. 

Just copy the file to ~/.ros/map.bag (if you run MowgliBase and MowgliRover on the same Raspi you dont need to do anything extra.)

Start mowgli_rviz with

```
~/MowgliBase/scripts/rviz.sh
```

After the inital map.bag has been captured, the file ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag is created with "layers" of additional information, the original map.bag is stored as "mowing_area" layer.

Other layers are current "gps_rtk_fix_type" and "gps_xy_acc".

If you want to reset your collected data you need to delete ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag

### Layer: gps_rtk_fix_type

   0.5 = RTK FIX (good)

   1.0 = RTK FLOATING FIX (bad)

   *Higher (worse) datapoints overwrite lower (good) datapoints, so you'll get a map of where GPS is worst* 

### Layer: gps_xy_acc

   \<value\> = /ublox/navpvt/hAcc - Horizontal Accuracy in cm 

   *Higher (worse) datapoints overwrite lower (good) datapoints, so you'll get a map of where GPS is worst*

## Configuration

   GridMap is configured in **~/MowgliBase/src/mowgli_rviz/config/mowgli.yaml**
   
   (Check [GridMap Filters](https://github.com/ANYbotics/grid_map#grid_map_filters) for cool filtering options.)

   The .launch file supports the following parameters

   **openmower_map_path** (default ~/.ros/map.bag)
   **mowgli_map_path** (default Â ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag )

## TODO

 * Only supports one "mowing_area" at the moment, no nav areas are visualized either
 * Get that data via a service instead of having to copy map.bag around 
 * More data layers (Battery Voltage, Current, IMU Data (bumpiness), Motor currents, ...
