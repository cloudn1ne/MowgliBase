# MowgliRViz

Is a data collector that taps into existing topics like /odom or /ublox/navpt to gather information "at" the bots current location and feed that into a GridMap

## Get started 

As mowgli_rviz does not know the mowing area, you need to supply it the map.bag file from ~/.ros/map.bag on your Bot at least once. Just copy the file into wherever
you run mowgli_rviz ~/.ros/map.bag - if you run MowgliBase and MowgliRover on the same Raspi you dont need to do anything extra.

After the inital map.bag has been captured a file ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag is created with "layers" of additional information, the original map.bag is stored into "mowing_area".
Other layers are current "gps_rtk_fix_type" and "gps_xy_acc".

If you want to reset your collected data you need to delete ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag

### "gps_rtk_fix_type"

   0.5 = RTK FIX (good)

   1.0 = RTK FLOATING FIX (bad)

   higher (worse) datapoints overwrite lower (good) datapoints, so you'll get a map of where GPS is worst 

### "gps_xy_acc"

   <value> = /ublox/navpvt/hAcc - Horizontal Accuracy in cm 

   higher (worse) datapoints overwrite lower (good) datapoints, so you'll get a map of where GPS is worst

## Configuration

   GridMap is configured in ~/MowgliBase/src/mowgli_rviz/config/mowgli.yaml

   .launch file supports the following parameters

   "openmower_map_path" (default ~/.ros/map.bag)
   "mowgli_map_path" (default Â ~/.ros/mowgli_map.bag )

## TODO

 * Only supports one "mowing_area" at the moment, no nav areas are visualized either
 * Get that data via a service instead of having to copy map.bag around 
 * More data layers (Battery Voltage, Current, IMU Data (bumpiness), Motor currents, ...
